# Changelog

All notable changes to Obsync. Versions are the MSI/installer baselines; dates are build dates.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-07

- **Database Timeline** — the History page gained a Timeline view: runs grouped by day with change
  totals, expandable per-run object lists, and click-through to the diff viewer preselected at the
  clicked object. Search now also matches database names and the triggering user.
- **Dependency Explorer** — new Dependencies tab in the Job Workspace: pick any synced object and
  see what depends on it (referencing modules, foreign-key tables, triggers) and what it uses,
  read live from the server. Click a dependency to drill into it.
- **Generated schema documentation** — each database now gets `docs/README.md` committed next to
  its scripts: an object index plus a data dictionary (column types, nullability, defaults, keys,
  and `MS_Description` descriptions). Regenerates only when the schema changes.
- **Security reviews** — each run writes `security/security-review.md` per database (guest access,
  grants to `public`, high-risk grants, `db_owner` members, orphaned users, `TRUSTWORTHY`) and
  `server/security-review.md` with the server pass (`sysadmin` members, `sa` enabled, password
  policy, high-risk server grants). Versioned, so posture drift shows up as commits.

> Upgrading note: each existing job's first run after 0.6.0 commits the two new generated files —
> that is the feature rollout, not drift.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-07

- **Update checks** — notify-only: a startup toast (at most daily, once per version) and a manual
  check in Settings → About. Only the GitHub releases endpoint is ever contacted.
- **Audit hardening** — every run (including scheduled service runs) now writes a run-outcome audit
  event with commit SHA and push result; the complete audit trail exports as CSV or JSON from
  Settings.
- **Repositories page redesign** — single full-width list with an Add/Edit dialog, plus a
  "Check token" action that re-validates the stored token's permissions against GitHub.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-06

- **VLDB performance** — incremental scripting (per-type `modify_date` watermarks; unchanged
  objects skip scripting entirely from the third run), parallel SMO scripting, and batched
  state/change/log persistence. UI hardening for huge runs (capped grids, streamed reports).
- **Enterprise installer** — branded dialogs, bundled MinGit (SHA-pinned), Windows Event Log
  source, service recovery settings, silent-install service account properties, production
  license & third-party notices.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-06

- **Server-level objects** — logins, server roles, credentials, linked servers, and SQL Agent
  jobs/operators/alerts scripted under `server/`, plus an always-on `server-configuration.sql`.
- **Drift alerting** — SMTP and webhook alerts on failure/warning/changes, fired after runs from
  both the app and the service.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-06

- **Dynamic database scope** — "All user databases", resolved live each run.
- **Reference data versioning** — selected lookup tables exported as deterministic INSERT scripts.
- **Script & diff viewer** — inspect any run's changes side-by-side or unified, offline, from the
  local clone.
- Daily-driver options: run-history retention, git committer identity, workspaces root override,
  job export/import, run-failure notifications.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-02

Initial installer baseline: SQL Server → GitHub schema sync (metadata fast-path + SMO), change
detection with per-object state, direct-commit and pull-request modes, export/local-only modes,
scheduling via the Windows service, audit log, token permission checker, least-privilege SQL
permission generator, proxy support, maintenance windows, `.obsyncignore`, run reports,
environment tags, and the WPF app with dashboard, jobs, history, and diagnostics.
